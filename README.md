# Event Viewer Core

Java Spring Boot Restful application serving event logs

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Java JDK 8, Docker (Community Edition should be fine), and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You will also need a text/code editor. In this case Visual Studio Code is used. But you are free to use any Code Editor or IDE that can work with Spring Boot, Java, and Maven.

### Running the code

To run the code, use the following command from a terminal/command line

```./mvnw spring-boot:run```

The application should then be running on <http://localhost:8080>

You can edit the code through Visual Studio code by using the VS code Workspace file: `vscode.workspace`. There are recommended extensions that should help with development if you choose to use them. Another alternative to work with the code is to import it as a Maven Project in Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite.
